Exploring the world of coffee through data! â˜•ðŸ“Š I recently took on a project to analyze and visualize coffee sales data using Excel, transforming raw data into meaningful insights. Hereâ€™s a glimpse into the process and techniques I used:

Data Cleaning & Transformation
XLOOKUP Function: I utilized the powerful XLOOKUP function to seamlessly populate data from multiple tables. Customer details like names, emails, and countries were pulled from the customer table, while coffee-specific data such as coffee type, roast type, size, and unit price came from the product table.

Data Standardization: To make the data more understandable, I standardized abbreviations in coffee and roast types. For instance, I converted short forms like "Rob" into "Robusta" and "m" into "Medium Roast" using the IF function. This transformation made the data more accessible and visually appealing.

Visualizations & Insights
Dynamic Pivot Charts: I crafted a dynamic line chart using a pivot table that shows sales trends over time. The rows are organized by month and year, with coffee type names as columns and sales as values. This provides a clear view of how different coffee types perform across various periods.

Custom Timeline: To enhance the analysis, I incorporated a custom timeline filter that allows easy navigation through different order months and years, providing a smooth and interactive experience.

Slicers for Detailed Analysis: To further drill down into the data, I added slicers for size, roast type name, and loyalty card status. These slicers make it effortless to filter the data and analyze specific segments or customer behaviors.

Bar Chart for Geographic Insights: I created another pivot chart as a bar chart to display sales by country. This visual helps in identifying top-performing regions and understanding geographical preferences for different coffee types.
